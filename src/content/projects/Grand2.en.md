# Grand-2

![image:Grand-2](https://i.imgur.com/7UIMZpm.png)

An editor plugin for ManiaPlanet which allows you to map with other players.

Mapping in Trackmania is awesome but why not sharing this experience with other players, that was the objective of Grand-2, a restart of an old project named Grand, I’ve made a PoC that was working nicely. 

But since the map editor API is way too incomplete (cf. this [post](https://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=279&t=46381&p=310337#p310337)), it was nearly impossible to do good-enough working version with current ManiaPlanet, so I’ve decided to stop working on this project.

After a lot of messages on the previous post, Nadeo decided to update the API, but with the new coming Trackamnia, ManiaPlanet is now on hold and doesn’t have updates anymore, so this project is definitely on hold. Recently the requested changes were introduced in the new game, so version 3 of Grand is in mind!
