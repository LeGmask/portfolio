Contributor for schoolsyst, a web app designed to help students throughout their entire days, from note-taking to grades-managing.

For schoolsyst I've fixed some bug on the webapp and also find some bug. But most of my work I've done is the electron port of the webapp, because I use a computer everyday in class so a desktop app was more usefull than a simple webapp.
