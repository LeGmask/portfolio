Contributor schoolsyst, an all-in-one web application to manage grades, homework, schedule and much more.

For schoolsyst, in addition to reporting bugs and implementing fixes. I created the electron *(pc)* port of the web application. Indeed, every day I work in class on my computer and I could not use the web application.
