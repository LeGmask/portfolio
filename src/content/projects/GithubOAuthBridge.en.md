# Github OAuth Bridge

![image:GithubOAuthBridge](https://i.imgur.com/bEi7ZO3.png)

Transform none understandable OAuth request into a prefect GitHub OAuth request.

This webapp permit to bridge to the GitHub Oauth. The fact is GitHub Oauth wasnâ€™t working with Alexa Skill Oauth, so this bridge permit to transform the Alexa Oauth request to a request that GitHub Oauth will understand.

This is more of a PoC *(Proof of Concept)* than a real production ready project. But it works well for my use case :smile:!
