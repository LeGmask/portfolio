# Github OAuth Bridge

![image:GithubOAuthBridge](https://i.imgur.com/bEi7ZO3.png)

Turns an incomprehensible OAuth request into a perfect GitHub OAuth request.

This API allows to bridge the gap between the Github OAuth and a non-compatible OAuth. I made this project, because the Alexa OAuth was not functional with the Github one. So it allows to transform this request into an understandable request for the GitHub OAuth.

This project, even if it is still a PoC *(Proof of Concept)*, works pretty well for the use I have :smile:!
