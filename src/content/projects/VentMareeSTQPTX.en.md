A Skill of weather information on Saint-Quay-Portrieux, in Côtes d'Armor Region Brittany France.

This weather skill covering the city of Saint-Quay-Portrieux allows you to consult the tide times for the day and the next 24 hours, gives live wind strength, informs about the weather forecast for the next days, etc ...

I created this skill because as a sailor I wanted to have a quick and complete overview of the conditions on the water from a single access point.
