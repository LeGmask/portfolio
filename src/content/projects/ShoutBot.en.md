# ShoutBot

ShoutBot, a bridge to link Ti-Planet Discord and Ti-Planet chat.

I’m the cocreator of ShoutBot, a discord and Ti-Planet bot to link official Ti-Planet discord and the official chat.

This bot is a full rewrite of an existing project, why a new project? The first project was not at all useable, extendable, and was more about a proof of concept, that’s why with Lesyija we’ve built a fully new project.

That why ShoutBot idea comes, a more efficient version and with a bunch of new features, like latex support Discord side, or self-bot support to increase your total amount of message of the year, and still be the most active user directly from Discord.
