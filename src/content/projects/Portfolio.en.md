# Portfolio

![image:Portfolio](https://i.imgur.com/neexUOB.png)

My own website/portfolio. But it's also a blog where I will share my adventures.

What about a new way to discover my projects and share all my adventure? Yes, that’s why I’ve built this portfolio. This website is a new place where i will post blog post and projects page, for to all the newcomers that discover me.

After too much hour of designing and development, I’ve made it, my **own** portfolio without any website maker or any other cheats!

Also in this project I use Markdown dynamically generated at build, with a parser and converted into Json. Why? The fact is that creating a page with react is great and easy, but it takes time, and I don’t have time, so I’ve decided to generate page automatically at build for all my articles or projects. How? At build there a script that is parsing the content folder and generate an adapted Json that the webapp will understand and render in a wonderful page!
