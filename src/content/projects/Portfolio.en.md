# Portfolio

![image:Portfolio](https://i.imgur.com/neexUOB.png)

My personal website/portfolio, but also my blog where I can share my adventures.

To showcase my different projects, and share my different adventures.

I worked on the design and developed this site alone, without a "site builder" (type: WordPress or other).

In order to facilitate the future creation of my project pages and blog posts, I decided to write them using the [Markdown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language . These files are parsed during compilation, without any intervention on the source code, limiting the work necessary to add a page on the site.
