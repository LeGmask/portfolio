# Omega

![image:Omega](https://i.imgur.com/6vedtxH.png)

Contributor for Omega, a fork of Numworks’ OS, Epsilon. That brings many features.

Omega extends Epsilon by adding some features, such as a theme engine, external apps, a periodic table… Omega is for the people who want to add features to the calculator, but cannot because they have been rejected by Numworks (for reasons that are 100% understandable!)

I’ve joined the Omega team a bit after the beginning of the project, in December 2019. And I’ve done a few things for the project.

In particular I’ve made a docker as an easy way to compile. Also I’ve made function settings for native nth root and a least I’ve added support for the infinity symbol.
