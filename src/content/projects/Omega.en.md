# Omega

![image:Omega](https://i.imgur.com/6vedtxH.png)

Contributor on the Omega project, a fork of the Numworks OS, Epsilon. 

Omega extends the capabilities of Epsilon by adding many features like a theme engine, external applications, periodic table... Omega is for people who want to add features to the calculator, but can't because they were rejected by Numworks (for totally understandable reasons!).

I joined the Omega team shortly after the start of the project, in December 2019, and worked on adding several features to the system.

I notably set up a Docker in order to make the compilation easier. I also implemented a parameter for functions to get the n-th roots without going through the toolbox and added support for the infinity symbol.
