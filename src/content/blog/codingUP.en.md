Sunday March 21st was the [c0d1ngup](http://codingup.fr), the 7th edition of the programming challenge organized by the university of Poitiers. A 100% online experience for my first one (thanks COVID) that I shared with Afyu. Our duo was ranked first in our group A.S.P.I.C.

# Challenges:

The contest was presented in the form of challenges and puzzles around the theme of Harry Potter. their resolution required a little programming, thinking, and inventiveness. This year 24 challenges were available. From a distance, armed with our microphones and our keyboards, we solved 16 of them (15 accepted + 1 not counted because submitted 30 seconds after the end of the challenge :cry : ). So we were able to place ourselves at the first position of our A.S.P.I.C group (each group corresponds to a level, A.S.P.I.C includes "high school + higher education").

# I'm curious, what were the challenges?

The challenges will be published on [Pydéfis](https://pydefis.callicode.fr/), at a rate of 1 per week according to this [schedule](http://codingup.fr/?p=2376). However, if you are curious, you can always look at the challenges from previous years on [Pydéfis](https://pydefis.callicode.fr/).
