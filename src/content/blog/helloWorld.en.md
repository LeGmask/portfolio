# Hello World !

At the end of november 2020, I got the idea of this project, and decided to launch it, so I started by maturing the idea in a corner of my head, then I finally decided to try to design the site using the famous Adobe XD software. Then followed a long period of work to think about how to make a beautiful modern site. It's after 2 weeks of work that I finally got a proper version to start developing my website:

*A second step is then the development :*

## Developement :

### The techs

In order to realize my project a first choice is necessary, which technologies to use ? 
For the Framework, I quickly chose React. I chose this Framework for several reasons: 
- Only JavaScript, which allows a simple hosting without server, and for that I chose Vercel but we will talk about it later;

- In order to learn React, I know very little about the web, and learning a new Framework allows me to follow the evolution of the web. I also learned object-oriented programming with this project; 

- As for NodeJS, I know very well the ecosystem and this will allow me to avoid "junk code" or I discover the language or, when I install unnecessary dependencies;

- Then comes the deployment, to facilitate the continuous integration "CI" with my GitHub repository, I chose Vercel, the system is very complete and allows a very pleasant development.
Come after the modules to complete React, for the style I chose sass, and more precisely the scss. It is a CSS preprocessor, which makes CSS so much cleaner and more pleasant in my opinion. 

- For the contents of the blogs post and the project pages I chose Remark, a Markdown parser. For the record, originally I was more attracted to MDX, but after complications with MDX integration, Remark seemed more relevant after a lot of effort trying to make MDX work the best. 

### Pure development

Then comes the fatal step, the integration of the model in Html, CSS and JS. This is the part that took me the most time. To work efficiently each feature had its own pull request, following the GitHub Flow, I did not reinvent the wheel, and if you want more information I refer you to the GitHub doc.

This is how I was able to produce this project, a great place where I can share my projects and write stories about my adventures.

## The after 

This project allowed me to discover the many facets of the web. I also discovered object-oriented programming during this project.

Nevertheless, I still have many ideas to improve this project in order to make it even better. Despite all the code is probably not optimal, but that's not why I'm not proud of it :yum:.
